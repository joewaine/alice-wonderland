## 1. The Eaglet

### Source Material

**Original Book Context:**
The Eaglet appears in Chapter III "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale." The character was based on Edith Liddell, one of Carroll's real-life companions during the boating expedition of July 4, 1862. In the text, the Eaglet tells Alice to "Speak English!" and comments that it doesn't know the meaning of many long words, bending down its head to hide a smile while other birds laugh.

**Tenniel Illustration:**
In Tenniel's Caucus Race illustration, the Eaglet appears among the assembled wet animals and birds with draggled feathers, all dripping wet and uncomfortable after swimming in Alice's pool of tears.

### Physical Description

**Species:** Young eagle (eaglet)
**Size:** Small to medium bird, juvenile proportions
**Key Features:**
- Uniform dark brown plumage with rich, warm tones
- Golden-brown feathers on the back of head and nape (the "golden" in golden eagle)
- Bold white band across tail feathers
- Clean white patches at base of wings
- Large round eyes with inquisitive expression
- Hooked beak, smaller and less curved than adult
- Fluffy, somewhat downy appearance (juvenile feathers)
- Oversized feet relative to body (juvenile proportions)

### Modern Interpretations

Most adaptations focus on the Dodo and Lory from the Caucus Race, leaving the Eaglet relatively unexplored. This provides creative freedom for a distinctive design.

**Design Opportunity:** Create a character that bridges realistic juvenile eagle features with anthropomorphic expressiveness - slightly larger eyes, more expressive beak positions.

### Suggested Color Palette

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Primary Brown | `#5C4033` | Main body plumage |
| Golden Nape | `#DAA520` | Head/neck feathers |
| Dark Brown | `#3D2914` | Wing tips, markings |
| Cream White | `#FFFDD0` | Tail band, wing patches |
| Eye Gold | `#FFD700` | Iris |
| Beak Gray | `#4A4A4A` | Beak base |
| Beak Tip | `#1A1A1A` | Beak tip |

### Body Proportions for 3D Modeling

- **Type:** Avian/bird creature
- **Head-to-body ratio:** 1:3 (slightly larger head for expressiveness)
- **Wing span:** 1.5x body length when extended
- **Leg length:** Short, sturdy legs with large talons
- **Tail:** Medium length, fan-shaped
- **Overall silhouette:** Round, fluffy body typical of juvenile birds

### Rigging Requirements

- **Rig Type:** Avian biped with wing bones
- **Key Joints:**
  - Neck (3-4 segments for head movement)
  - Wing bones (shoulder, elbow, wrist, primary/secondary feather groups)
  - Tail fan (for spread/close animations)
  - Legs (hip, knee, ankle, toe spread)
  - Beak (upper/lower for talking animations)
- **Animation Needs:** Walking waddle, flying hover, head tilts, wing flaps, talking

### AI Prompt Suggestions

## 2. The Duck

### Source Material

**Original Book Context:**
The Duck appears in Chapter III "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale" alongside the Dodo, Lory, and Eaglet. The character was based on Rev. Robinson Duckworth, who accompanied Carroll on the boating expedition. The Duck participates in the nonsensical Caucus Race where everyone runs in patterns of any shape, starting and stopping whenever they like, so that everyone wins.

**Tenniel Illustration:**
Tenniel depicted the Caucus Race animals standing in a haphazard circular arrangement along a shoreline. The Duck appears with the characteristic waterfowl features, rendered with precise cross-hatching technique to convey texture in feathers.

### Physical Description

**Species:** Duck (likely mallard-inspired)
**Size:** Medium bird, standard duck proportions
**Key Features:**
- Glossy bottle-green head with iridescent sheen
- White collar ring demarcating head from body
- Purple-tinged brown breast
- Grey-brown wings with blue-purple speculum (wing patch)
- Pale grey belly
- Black rear with white-bordered dark tail feathers
- Yellowish-orange bill tipped with black
- Small, alert eyes
- Webbed orange feet

### Modern Interpretations

Ducks in animation often feature exaggerated bill expressions and waddle movements. Disney's Donald Duck aesthetic (though different species) demonstrates how duck features can be stylized for character appeal.

**Design Direction:** Maintain the distinguished mallard coloring but add slight anthropomorphic touches - slightly larger eyes, more mobile bill for expressions, upright posture for conversations.

### Suggested Color Palette

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Iridescent Green | `#004D40` | Head |
| Head Highlight | `#00796B` | Head sheen |
| White Collar | `#FAFAFA` | Neck ring |
| Breast Brown | `#6D4C41` | Chest/breast |
| Wing Grey | `#78909C` | Main wing feathers |

## 3. Pat

### Source Material

**Original Book Context:**
Pat appears in Chapter IV "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill" as the White Rabbit's servant. He speaks with an Irish brogue, contrasting with the White Rabbit's formal English. When the Rabbit thinks Alice (grown giant in his house) is a monster, he asks Pat to climb down the chimney to remove her. Pat refuses, so Bill the Lizard is sent instead.

**Tenniel Illustration & Species Debate:**
Carroll never explicitly described Pat's species. Tenniel's illustration shows an ape-like figure, which scholars connect to Victorian satirical cartoons where Irish workers were depicted with simian features (often named "Pat" or "Paddy"). However, some interpretations suggest Pat could be a guinea pig. The ape appearance may be Tenniel's artistic choice rather than Carroll's intent.

### Physical Description

**Recommended Interpretation:** Anthropomorphic monkey/ape servant (following Tenniel's visual)

**Key Features:**
- Small, stocky simian build
- Rounded face with prominent features
- Expressive, slightly nervous eyes
- Small rounded ears
- Brown/tan fur coloring
- Victorian servant attire (waistcoat, cap, possibly apron)
- Hands capable of holding tools (gardening implements)
- Slightly hunched posture (subservient body language)

**Alternative Interpretation (Guinea Pig):**
- Round, compact body
- No visible tail
- Small ears
- Twitchy nose
- Soft brown/white fur
- Same Victorian servant clothing

### Modern Interpretations

Pat is rarely featured in adaptations, making this a relatively blank canvas. The character offers opportunity to create a memorable supporting cast member with distinctive personality conveyed through design.

**Design Direction:** Emphasize the working-class servant aesthetic with slightly worn but neat Victorian clothing. Expression should convey loyalty mixed with nervousness.

### Suggested Color Palette

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Fur Brown | `#8B7355` | Main fur color |
| Fur Light | `#C4A77D` | Face, chest, hands |
| Fur Dark | `#5D4E37` | Shadowed areas |
| Waistcoat Green | `#2E7D32` | Servant vest |
| Shirt White | `#ECEFF1` | Undershirt |
| Cap Brown | `#5D4037` | Flat cap |
| Apron Tan | `#D7CCC8` | Work apron |
| Eye Brown | `#3E2723` | Eyes |
| Nose Pink | `#FFAB91` | Nose |

### Body Proportions for 3D Modeling

## 4. The Puppy

### Source Material

**Original Book Context:**
The Puppy appears in Chapter IV "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill" after Alice shrinks to a tiny size and escapes into the White Rabbit's garden. To Alice, the puppy appears enormous, but it's actually a normal-sized dog. The puppy behaves like a real dog would - it stretches out a paw to touch her, chases a stick she throws, jumps with delight, and tumbles head over heels. Carroll specifically notes that this creature, unlike others in Wonderland, behaves exactly as expected.

**Tenniel Illustration:**
Tenniel depicted the Puppy as a Norfolk Terrier, drawing on Victorian conventions of pet portraiture. The illustration shows a realistic yet slightly exaggerated terrier, capturing both the creature's playful nature and the threat it poses to tiny Alice.

### Physical Description

**Species:** Norfolk Terrier (per Tenniel)
**Size:** Normal dog size, but appears giant to shrunken Alice
**Key Features:**
- Compact, sturdy body with low-to-ground build
- Wiry, shaggy coat texture
- Small, V-shaped folded ears
- Dark, round, alert eyes with eager expression
- Short muzzle with black nose
- Short, docked or natural stubby tail (often wagging)
- Strong legs for digging and chasing
- Wheaten, red, black and tan, or grizzle coloring

**Personality Expressed Through Design:**
- Tongue often lolling out
- Ears perked forward with interest
- Play bow posture capability
- Bouncy, energetic stance

### Modern Interpretations

Dogs in games often feature exaggerated expressiveness - larger eyes, more mobile ears, enhanced tail movements. The key is maintaining the "normal dog" quality that Carroll emphasized while making the character appealing.

**Design Direction:** Keep the terrier breed characteristics but stylize for the cel-shaded aesthetic. Emphasize the playful, innocent nature - this is the one creature in Wonderland that behaves normally.

### Suggested Color Palette

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Coat Wheaten | `#D4A574` | Main fur color |
| Coat Highlight | `#E8C89E` | Light areas, muzzle |
| Coat Shadow | `#A67C52` | Darker fur areas |
| Coat Tips | `#8B6914` | Wire hair highlights |
| Nose Black | `#1A1A1A` | Nose |
| Eye Brown | `#4E342E` | Eyes |
| Eye Highlight | `#795548` | Eye reflection |
| Tongue Pink | `#F48FB1` | Tongue |
| Inner Ear | `#FFCCBC` | Ear interior |

- **Head-to-body ratio:** 1:3.5
- **Leg length:** Short but sturdy (terrier proportions)
- **Muzzle:** Short to medium
- **Ears:** V-shaped, folded forward
- **Tail:** Short, carried high when alert
- **Overall build:** Muscular but compact, bred for agility

### Rigging Requirements

- **Rig Type:** Quadruped with facial rig
- **Key Joints:**
  - Spine (6-8 segments for bouncy movement)
  - Four legs with full leg hierarchy (hip/shoulder, knee/elbow, ankle/wrist, paw, toe spread)

## 5. The Caterpillar

### Source Material

**Original Book Context:**
The Caterpillar appears in Chapter V "Advice from a Caterpillar," sitting on a mushroom and smoking a hookah. He is portrayed as languid, philosophical, and slightly condescending, repeatedly asking Alice "Who are you?" His famous advice about the mushroom - one side makes you taller, one side makes you shorter - is crucial to Alice's size-changing abilities.

**Tenniel Illustration:**
Tenniel's illustration is a visual paradox where the caterpillar's human face appears to be formed from the head and legs of a naturalistic caterpillar. Key features:
- Sits atop a large mushroom, elevated above Alice
- The hookah coil wraps fully around his body, creating a bordered circular shape
- Human hands emerge from wide sleeves to grasp the hookah
- Eastern-inspired detailed hookah design
- Naturalistically drawn plants tower over tiny Alice in the background

### Physical Description

**Creature Type:** Anthropomorphic caterpillar with human features
**Size:** Large (roughly human torso-sized body)
**Key Features:**
- Elongated segmented body (11+ segments)
- Human-like face integrated into caterpillar head
- Multiple pairs of legs:
  - 3 pairs of true legs (thorax) - can be stylized as "arms"
  - 4-5 pairs of prolegs (abdomen)
  - Anal clasper/rear grip
- Sleepy, half-lidded eyes conveying wisdom/condescension
- Small antennae
- Plump, soft-looking segments
- Often depicted with hookah as key prop

### Modern Interpretations

**Disney 1951 Animated Film:**
- Blue coloring (iconic)
- Smokes hookah that creates colorful smoke forming letters/shapes
- Forthright, somewhat rude personality
- Minimal body articulation

**Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (2010):**
- Named "Absolem"
- Voiced by Alan Rickman
- Deep blue coloring
- Keeper of the Oraculum (history scroll)
- Eventually transforms into a blue butterfly
- More wise and less condescending than other versions

**American McGee's Alice (2000):**
- Darker, more grotesque interpretation
- Large larva with person-like face
- Maintains hookah and mushroom imagery
- Directs Alice to hunt the Centipede

## General Notes for All Characters

### Cel-Shading Characteristics

For consistency across all characters:
- **Bold black outlines** defining silhouettes and major forms
- **Flat color fields** with minimal gradient (2-3 tone shading max)
- **Vibrant, saturated hues** that pop
- **Clean separation** between light and shadow areas
- **Exaggerated proportions** for readability and appeal

### Tripo AI Best Practices

From Tripo's official guidance:
1. **Clear main subject** - Define the primary character explicitly
2. **Concrete details** - Include shape, style, materials, polycount targets
3. **Reflectivity properties** - Describe surface qualities
4. **Symmetry reminder** - Explicitly mention if symmetry is needed
5. **Clean reference images** - For image-to-3D, use clear subjects with solid backgrounds

### Rigging Priority

For game implementation, prioritize:
1. **The Caterpillar** - Most complex, start early
2. **The Puppy** - Quadruped rig needed
3. **Pat** - Humanoid base, simpler modifications
4. **The Duck** - Avian rig with waterfowl specifics
5. **The Eaglet** - Similar avian rig, can share base with Duck
